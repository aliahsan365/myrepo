# myrepo
codes written by me

In order to keep up with the current folders architecture do:

1. Open PowerShell as admin
2. Navigate to myrepo folder
3. Set RemoteSigned to allow run not signed local scripts with
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
4. run .\crear_carpetas.ps1
NOTE: For security reasons restore windows's 'Execution Policy' to default afterwards.
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
